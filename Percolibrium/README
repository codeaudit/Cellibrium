Here are various implementation representations of the reasoning
engine and knowledge representation.  The files marked "fs" for
filesystem use a simple file representation which makes the logic and
code simple, but has some limitations.

To test, 

 cd Percolators
 gcc -o conceptualize -g -std=c99 conceptualize-fs.c
 ./conceptualize ExampleTupleData/env_graph
 ./conceptualize ExampleTupleData/policy_graph
 ./conceptualize ExampleTupleData/domain_knowledge_graph

 cd ..
 cd Narrators
 gcc -o stories -g -std=c99 stories-fs.c
 ./stories "expectation value"
 ./stories linux 



The files in CGNgine which generate the semantic tuples are

libpromises/graph.c
libpromises/graph.h
libpromises/graph_defs.c
