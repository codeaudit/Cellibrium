CELLIBRIUM Project


This project expands on, and reworks, the latent AI/AR ideas that were
intoduced in CFEngine between 1998-2012, and were since abandoned for
the commercial activity. This work modifies and extends the concepts,
from Computer Immunology to Semantic Spacetimes, and embeds a mostly
compatible agent collection for users of CFEngine. Other agents will
be added in the future.

The CELLIBRIUM (CELLular equilIBRIUM (cerebellum)) supports a model of
distributed embedded reasoning for use in IoT, Cloud, and Applications
centric computing, including Smart Cities. It merges inputs from
automated RobIoTs and from Anthropods of humans! It supports workspaces,
as described in http://markburgess.org/workspaces.html

Code here is based on research into Semantic Spaces, found at 
http://markburgess.org/spacetime.html

For now, think of this as an experimental proof of concept cognitive
computing model

Details to be shared gradually, for interested parties.
