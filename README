Cellibrium
----------

This project expands on and reworks the latent AI ideas that were
intoduced in CFEngine between 1998-2012, and were since abandoned
publicly.

The cellibrium (cellular equilibrium cerebellum) supports a model of
distributed embedded reasoning for IoT, cloud, and applications like
Smart Cities. It is based on the author's research into Semantic
Spaces.
